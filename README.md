## Process

Read through the paper
Definitely feel like I need to read through it again

Found their application for finding counter examples interesting

In general still don't fully understand what is going on so going to read through it again and hopefully that clears things up

## Check-in

Reading through the paper again and going over piazza question https://piazza.com/class/kmu8utvan9v2rp?cid=29

Slowing grasping the relevance of the work and want to try and go through the class example we went over on 4/26 again on my own and see if I'm tracking with each step

Ah, so I is initially just a guess? We need to find a general enough I that we can solve for
I don't get why I needs to be a 'disjunction of two linear combinations of the given input variables plus a constant term' but I also havent read the paper again yet so maybe that will provide insight
